## 🧠 How Course Eligibility Works

- Courses are stored as documents with fields like prerequisites, corequisites, and term offerings.
- The app constructs a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** based on these relationships.
- Using **Kahn’s Algorithm**, it identifies all courses a student is now eligible to take.

## 🧾 Sample Course Format (Firestore)

```kotlin
mapOf(
    "code" to "CPE103-4",
    "name" to "Microprocessors",
    "units" to 3,
    "prerequisites" to listOf("CPE101-1"),
    "coRequisites" to listOf(),
    "regularTerms" to listOf(1, 2),
    "term" to 1,
    "yearLevel" to 3
)
